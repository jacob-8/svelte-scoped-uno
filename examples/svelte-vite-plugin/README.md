[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz_small.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/jacob-8/svelte-scoped-uno/tree/main/examples/svelte-vite-plugin)
*There is a strange bug just in StackBlitz whereby styles for the Logo and Prose components are not being applied, but it's still a useful way to quickly try things out.*

## Try Locally
- In the root of the monorepo run `pnpm install` and `pnpm try:svelte` or just run `npm install` and `npm run dev` from this directory if you don't use pnpm.
