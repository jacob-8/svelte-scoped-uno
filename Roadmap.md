- [UnoCSS Inspector doesn't work yet](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/issues/1718). PR's welcome! You would need to study how the `unocss:global` global does it by adding tokens to the tasks array via `tasks.push(extract(code, filename))`
- If you update the config during dev, you'll need to restart your server to see the updated changes, this could be solved by using Uno's ConfigHMRPlugin
